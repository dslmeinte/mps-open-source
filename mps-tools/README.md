# README: _MPS tools_

## `GenSnapshotter`

Goal: create a snapshot of generated source in MPS solutions.

Usage:

```
java -cp mpsTools.jar mps.tools.GenSnapshotter <projectDir> <targetDir> [<exclExt_1>...<exclExt_n>]
```

* `projectDir` is path to an MPS-project
* `targetDir` is path to/of target directory, which should not exist
* `exclExt_1`...`exclExt_n` are optional arguments with file extensions to be excluded

It copies files generated by MPS' generation process to a given target path, preserving the directory structure of files generated under solutions in a given MPS project.
This is meant to make a snapshot of generations, to be able to compare generated files between versions of generators.
It doesn't copy MPS-own generation artifacts (such as files called `checkpoints`, and `trace.info`), and also elides the sub path `source_gen` at the target path.
It also skips any file which has one of the file extensions to exclude.


### TODOs

1. Provide possibility to input paths to solutions directly from stdin.
