# MPS Open Source

This repository contains open source "stuff" (languages, mainly) made with/in/for [JetBrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) (=Meta-Programming System).
For now that means: a language to author [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) with.

Open the directory `mps-open-source` in MPS as a Project.

Development currently takes place with MPS version 2017.3.6 (#MPS-173.1812).
