# TODOs

Some notes for me personally about what I still might like to do.
Not meant as an actual roadmap!


## Capabilities

1. &#10003; Be aware of (alternative) file structures of a module.
1. ... Export structure of languages, directly from XML to JSON.
1. ... Generate Kotlin code for deserializing models from XML.
1. ... Export models, directly from XML to JSON.
1. Track dependencies, and check for incorrect/unmatched language versions, and such.
1. Warn about unused (i.e., not referenced from `.mps/modules.xml`) modules.
    Or more generally: compare project/modules on disk with `.mps/modules.xml`, and generate fixes.


## Notes

* [polling with Java NIO](https://dzone.com/articles/event-driven-architecture-over-polling-architecture), for making things incremental
* [serialize references to JSON, without infinite recursion](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/misc/jackson/json-identity-info-annotation.html)
